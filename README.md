# A-modern-perspective-on-the-video-game-industry

The principal aim of this work is to inspect several aspects of the video game industry, in order to gain
valuable insight into the mechanics of the gaming community. The data analyzed in the following work
comes from various sources and relates to dierent characteristics of video games, so that we can carry out a
thorough analysis encompassing multiple areas, which can provide us with a broader view of the video game
market as a whole.
The work is organized in dierent chapters as follows:
• Chapter 1 will be devoted to modern technologies of web scraping and API communication;
• Chapter 2 will be devoted to a rst classication of the game parameters needed for our analysis.
The main goal of this section can be summarized by the following question: \If I were to represent
a video game company, or even a single \indie" developer willing to introduce a brand new game in
the international market, what parameters should I follow in order to make my game successful?".
In order to answer this question, in the rst place we have to understand what parameters identify a
game, and, secondly, how we can dene the concept of \successful": as we will see, this second part
will be strongly in
uenced by our nal results, making somehow the denition of success in the video
game market a little bit dierent from the common meaning;
• In Chapter 3 we will apply dierent statistical learning techniques in order to understand how to
properly predict the average time that users spend on video games, interpreted as a parameter of the
quality of a game. We will explore dierent methods in order to achieve this goal, and assess their
accuracy, in order to determine the model that best ts our data;
• In Chapter 4 we will conduct a time series analysis in order to understand the evolution of video
game sales over the years. We will attempt to understand if it is convenient for a company to launch a
video game in a particular month, we will try to investigate any possible trend and we will see if there
is a golden era for the video game market by using an econometric model;
• In Chapter 5 we are going to analyze how games can aect young players' aggressiveness based on
time spent playing video games. In addition, we shall gure out how dierences in preferences in
time spent on games depending on gender. In particular, from the perspective of our overall analysis,
we asked such question:\If I were to present myself as a game developer, should I take into account,
since nowadays more and more young people are playing online games, the potential harm that a video
game could have on the behavior of a player? If so, then my game may stumble upon censorship and
criticism".
